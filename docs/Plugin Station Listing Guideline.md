# Plugin Station Listing Guideline

You’ve finished building your plugin, tested it, and implemented user feedback, which means your plugin is ready to be reviewed by the Allxon team, hurrah! 

In the next section, we’ll walk you through when and how to submit your plugin to Allxon Plugin Station. Be sure to read this carefully, as it contains information that will lead to a successful review.

## Monthly listing timeline

We will open the opportunity to list new plugins on Plugin Station *once a month*. Please get in touch with your Allxon contact window for upcoming listing dates. To ensure the quality and safety of our Plugin Station, developers must submit the necessary information at least **three weeks** before the listing date.

There are two things that we will do when we receive  your plugin submission. 

- [Plugin Review](#submit-your-plugin): To ensure that the submitted plugins comply with our policies and guidelines, and meet legal requirements and user experience standards, we will review each plugin, which usually takes *5-10 working days*. If any issues are found during the reviewing process, developers must address them immediately and resubmit the plugin for review. 
  
  

- [Listing Content Curation](_img/Listing_Content_A.svg): Once your plugin has been successfully reviewed, we will prepare the plugin’s product page based on your submitting content, which usually takes *3-5 working days*.

Developers should reserve sufficient time for the plugin review process, as there may be back-and-forth communication that could potentially cause delays.

## Submit Your Plugin

Once your plugin is ready to release, fill out the [**Plugin Review Submission Form**](https://share.hsforms.com/1qQowbU1iSy-R7-LBUykGFg4e307) and submit all the requested information to help us review. Let's browse through the guidelines and see what you will need to prepare beforehand. 

- **Build your plugin package**

  Make sure you follow the [instructions](../docs/Build%20a%20Plugin%20Package.md) to build your plugin package.  In the last section, you can find the plugin online installer that is the script for how Allxon Plugin Station installs a plugin.  Make sure to test it before submitting your plugin package. 

- **Set up a demo device on Allxon Portal**

  Provide the URL of a demo device on Allxon Portal. We will quickly browse through and review the functions you claimed. 

- **Set a demo video of the plugin**

  Provide the URL of the video clip to demonstrate the user scenario and show us how the plugin works.

  Provide full access to your plugin. If your plugin includes account-based features, provide either an active demo account or any other resources that might be needed to review your plugin. 

## Submit Listing Content

Once your plugin passes review, it’s ready to be published onto Allxon Plugin Station.
